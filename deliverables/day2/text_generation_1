result:  Upon the briny deep, where Neptune's wrath

Lies hidden beneath waves that hide his scorn,

There roam the black-hearted sons of death and stealth,

Pirate lords, who scoff at dawn's bright morn.

Upon their shoulders rests a heavy creed,

Of freedom wild, of gold and plunder vast,

For they are spirits borne of salt seas fed,

Whose souls can never be confined nor cast.

With flags aloft that fly in stormy gale,

They sail the skies with vengeance in their wake,

Upon the winds, their spirits set to sail,

Their hearts a-throb with passion and their spake.

"Hark ye, my comrades brave, let us unsheathe

The cutlass sharp, the pistol at the ready,

For we have sworn on oceans deep to meet

The fiends of law who seek our lives to take.

We'll board their ships with cries of 'Scatter!' and 'Yield!'

And plunder gold where treasures lie in wait,

And leave behind us naught but fear and wail,

Our names forever etched upon the fate."

So sail they forth to claim what is their due,

To carve their mark upon the endless sea.

For though our days be numbered as the few,

We'll live them proudly, wild and wild and free.

result: Ode to Neptune's Crew, with hearts so free and bold,

In tales of yore and legends untold.

On high seas wide where horizons meet askew,

Brave buccaneers sail 'neath skies blue hue.


With sails that catch the wind's mighty roar,

Our gallant ship from shore to distant lore does soar.

We plunder not for gold nor riches dire and grim,

But for freedom’s sweet embrace without guilt or crime.


A life of liberty we choose with every swell's crest,

In the artful dance where pirates are blessed.

No crown demands our loyalty; no land holds sway

For on these waves and deeds alone do we stay.


Yet fear not for treasure lost or bounties to be claimed,

Our greatest wealth lies in unity remaimed.

Shiver me timbers with camaraderie's might!

In the ship’s heart where daylight dareth never light.


Forsooth we thrive not by conquest or woe,

But 'midst raucous laughter and tales of yore that flow.

A world beyond society's strict decree –

Where every man’s voice matters with equal degree.


Yet shadows cast o'er hearts unkind do loom,

For not all men seek the sea as their home or room.

Still let us sail beyond horizon and time,

In Neptune’s realm where we find our prime.


Let every siren song that calls to hearts of steel

Remind thee this life's not just about piracy zeal:

It lies in the freedom found amidst a brine-soaked breeze,

In Neptune’s embrace where one can truly be at ease.


For even as we chase horizons yet unknown

Let not our souls to loneliness or fear groan:

United in freedom's unyielding hold,

We are pirates true and tales forever told.

result: **The Jolly Pirate's Song**

Hark, ye knaves and landlubbers, gather 'round!
A tale I tell, of freedom, bold and profound.
Of salty spray upon our weathered cheek,
And boundless seas where pirates dare to speak.

With ship in tow, a black flag high we fly,
The sun doth scorch us as we soar the sky.
On every mast, a sword does gleam so bright,
A challenge posed to merchant ships' cruel plight.

For who are they, these pompous lords on land,
To steal our wealth, command and take with hand?
Their laws are naught, their greed a hollow curse,
While we, the free, will leave them in their verse!

With every plundered chest, a pirate's cheer,
We dance and sing upon the ocean's ear.
No king or lord can bind our souls to chains,
For freedom sings, a melody that stains
The very heart of those who fear the sea,
The Jolly Pirate's song, forever free!

So raise a glass, ye comrades brave and bold,
To life on waves, where tales are yet untold.
With every storm, with every whispered breeze,
We sail on, pirates, beneath the starry seas!
