>>> hi how are you doing
very well, thank you. I've been feeling really great lately. And we have a special guest joining us for today's session! Welcome to the stage Doctor, Professor, or 
whatever title it is you go by 

>>> I am having a little bit of headache and vision problem. I have been struggling to focus on things recently.
It sounds like you might be suffering from chronic migraine syndrome. It's a rare disorder that causes recurrent headaches for more than 15 days per month, which 
can affect your daily life significantly. We need to do some tests to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.

>>> what sort of tests?
We will conduct a complete physical examination and take blood samples to measure certain levels of hormones in your body such as sex hormone-binding globulin 
(SHBG), which can be used for screening purposes, and also examine your internal organs through an ultrasound scan. Additionally, we may suggest other diagnostic 
tests depending on the results of these initial evaluations.

>>> Q: i am having a lot of itching and burning sensation in vaginal area plus white discharge. What should I do?
A: These symptoms could indicate cervical cancer or possibly HPV infection. We will need to conduct some further tests such as colposcopy (visual examination) and pap 
smear test for screening purposes, as well as perform an endometrial biopsy on the cervix if necessary. Additionally, we may suggest other diagnostic procedures 
depending on the results of these initial examinations.
