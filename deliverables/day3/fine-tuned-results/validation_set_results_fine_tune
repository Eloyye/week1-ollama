Q: Doctor, I have been experiencing a cough and some abnormal movement of my eyelid. I have also noticed some symptoms with my eyes.
A: Based on your symptoms, it is possible that you are suffering from blepharitis or meibomian cyst. We will need to do a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis.
This may include slit-lamp examination, ophthalmologic consultation and other therapeutic procedures if necessary. Depending on the severity of your condition, we
may also recommend surgical interventions such as otoplasty/plastic surgery or refractive eye surgery in order to improve your vision quality and restore balance
and symmetry. We will need to conduct further assessments of your overall health status before making any final decisions about treatment options.

Q: Doctor, I've been experiencing Coryza lately, any idea what could be causing it?
A: It is possible that you are suffering from a viral or bacterial infection of the nasal cavity. This can cause symptoms such as coughing up mucus and pain around
the nose area (sinusitis). We will need to conduct further tests in order to determine the exact cause of your symptoms. Depending on the severity, we may
recommend therapeutic procedures for treatment. It is also important that you take antibiotics if necessary to avoid any complications with the infection.

Q: Doctor, I've been feeling really weak lately and my heart rate seems to have decreased. Do you have any idea what could be causing this?
A: It is possible that you are suffering from Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). This can cause symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and a decrease in blood
pressure which may affect your body's normal functioning. We will need to conduct further assessments of your overall health status before making any final
decisions about treatment options. Depending on the severity, we may recommend therapeutic procedures for treatment or surgery in order to restore balance within
your heart system.
